General Doucmentation:


Please note that all these values are treated as Strings aside from userId, it does not need to be in quotations but it also doesn't break it


*please note that userID is the same value as the respective User's ID field in the Database*, 
Contacts and Users have the same ID 
Contacts = ID

Users = userID


The quotations are necessary! (aside from userID)  it shall fault otherwise


obviously replace INSERT INPUT HERE with the actual input
all values CAN be left blank EXCEPT userID


NOT case sensitive, alphanumeric and other characters are fine input for all fields excluding userID which should be positive numeric


Input will vary but the JSON input will generally look like 



{"name":"", "phone":"", "email":"", "userID":""}

for easier view, this is equivalent == 

{
	"name" : "INSERT INPUT HERE", 
	
	"phone" : "INSERT INPUT HERE", 
	
	"email" : "INSERT INPUT HERE", 
	
	"userID" : "INSERT INPUT HERE"
}
