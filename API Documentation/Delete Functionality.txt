Expects input as JSON in the format {"name":"", "phone": "", "email": "", "userID":""}

for easy viewing:

{
  "name": "",
  "phone": "",
  "email": "",
  "userID": ""
}



You can leave all fields black and it  won't break

it only goes

{
	"deletion": 0,
	"error": "Contact Not Found"
}

This only happens if the input is wrong, which it should never be. If you give
proper input, which any user can see when he choses to delete someone, then
it should return with

{
	"deletion": 1,
	"error": ""
}

This is success, 1 for yes , 0 for no
